# flappybirdnn

This is a project showcasing neural networks using NEAT. We have done this by recreating flappy bird in pygame. There are 2 game modes - AI and Player Mode. The AI works using NEAT and produces the results for the best genome after a customizable number of generations. This project can be used as a basis for implementation of neural networks in video games, how they can be used to tweak difficulty and how they produce acceptable results more efficiently than other methods. NEAT is a very beginner friendly tool for achieving this.
